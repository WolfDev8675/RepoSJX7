> Out of these packages python comes shipped with _tkinter_ and _random_ packages. 
> If any issues is faced with packages it is recomended to 
> run command _**`python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`**_ or _**`py -m pip install -r requirements.txt`**_ in the Developer Command prompt,
> which will install all packages that were live in the python library when this coding was being done.
