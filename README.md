### *Target of the Project work*
With the advent of technology placing a small window to the worlds of each people expcept for the ones living a hobbit's life under a dark cave or communities of tribes cutoff from the modern world completely, its no doubt that E-Commerce is a booming industry and with their large turnover every year in comparison to the various industries besides them having decades of history in shaping mankind.

Our project is primarily a machine learning work and in tandem with its title "Predict Rating from Reviews for E-Commerce Sites" is primarily tasked with generating a machine algorithm that understands the reviews posted by users and determine the aggregate rating of a product bought by them, whether the product is recommendable to any future buyers or be scrapped from the listing due to poor performance, ultimately understand the sentiment of the the buyer conveyed in the reviews. Thus we need to employ NLP(Natural Language Processing) to understand the words of the review and ultimately make the system understand and make out the ideas conveyed. 

Besides learning the sentiment of a review we need to as per the preset provisions made for this project, hit the following roadblocks while we are understanding sentiments
1. Load the dataset 
2. Clear the dataset
3. Explore the dataset
4. Create the visualization
5. Train on all the Models
6. Create a summary of Model which model is best and why
