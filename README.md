>__Startup point__:
>  _FinalEngine.py_
---
>__Requirements__: The code for operating properly requires the following packages, it is recomended to check their presence and update definitions if needed.
> 
> Packages required 
> - io
> - matplotlib
> - numpy
> - pandas
> - pandastable
> - random
> - scikit-learn
> - sklearn
> - time
> - tkinter
> 
> Out of these packages python comes shipped with _**tkinter**_, _**io**_, _**time**_ and _**random**_ packages. 
> If any issues is faced with packages it is suggested to 
> run command _**`python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`**_ or _**`py -m pip install -r requirements.txt`**_ in the Developer Command prompt,
> the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/WolfDev8675/RepoSJX7/blob/Assign3_1/requirements.txt) will install all packages that were live in the python library when this coding was being done.
