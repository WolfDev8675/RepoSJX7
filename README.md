## Machine Learning Project 2 (BSE+MAKAUT)

## Removing hate speech Twitter tweets 
---
### *Target of the Project work*
It is no doubt that social media platforms are a big forefront of todays globlized world, and also we cannot deny the fact that racial discrimination and hate attacks is as unfortunate as is disastrous for the peace of society and for a platform, thus their mitigation is a very important and pressing issue for these social media platforms like Twitter, FaceBook, Whatsapp, WeChat, etc. 
<br></br>
In this project we will be trying to detect and remove hate-speech in the twitter front using NLP(Natural Language Processing). Here we will use a set of Machine Learning Algorithms along with NLP algorithms to detect a tweet and understand if it a __hate tweet__ or not and thereby try to remove if it involves or likely to spread any kind of hatred 

Besides this on the surface level we need to follow through the following points of work flow for the project as given below
1. Load the dataset 
2. Clear the dataset
3. Explore the dataset
4. Create the visualization
5. Train on all the Models
6. Create a summary of Model which model is best and why
