## Case Study: Brent oil Price Prediction
> __*Case Study for Predicting Brent Oil Price fluctuations*__ 

* The Main objective of the Study is to understand the price value for Brent Crude Oil 
* The Scope of the study will involve the accessing the Crude oil data for price fluctuations and studying it for understanding how the price fluctuates, the trends,
seasonal rise or fall, the nature of rise or fall, predicting to the nearest value of the future price for the user of the module to make an informed investment.
* The target we are setting out for the project is to use multiple modules of machine-learning and algorithm techniques to determine the price
* At the final conclusion of the study the codework when executed will be able to determine and tell to the perfect zero the price of the open of the new day's share.
