**For removal of NAN values by KNN method suitable lines need to be uncommented in section 5 refer lines 
**For following LogisticRegression path section 9 & 10 needs to be activated 
	and section 11 to be deactivated also changes need to be made in section 12 in model creation refer lines
**For following DecisionTree path section 9 & 10 needs to be deactivated 
	and section 11 to be activated also changes need to be made in section 12 in model creation refer lines
